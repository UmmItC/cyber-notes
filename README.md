I am a guy preparing for the OSCP exam, sharing my knowledge and experience in the field of penetration testing and red teaming. This is a place to collect and share my cybersecurity insights, especially in penetration testing and red teaming, including CTFs, write-ups, tools, scripts, and more. As I prepare for the OSCP exam, I will also share my notes and resources.
